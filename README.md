# clipbook-meego
The award winning clipbook app for Legendary  Nokia N9  running Meego - Harmattan.
One of the first apps that popularised the concept of retaining clipboard history on mobile devices, even before famous implementations of LG and UC Browser grabbed everyone's attention.
This app was among the top 8 apps qualified for LinuxTag 2012 App Contest's prize of a brand new shiny Nokia N9 developer device. http://wiki.qt.io/LinuxTag-2012-App-Contest

The app is available for download at, (though not maintained anymore) https://openrepos.net/content/bibek/clipbook-pro
